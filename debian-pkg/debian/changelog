dnf (4.2.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    + Update to standards version 4.4.0.1. No changes necessary.
    + Fix homepage.
    + Change dependency on *-hawkey to *-libdnf.
    + Add versioned dependency to *-libdnf dependencies for >= 0.35.3-1~.
    + Add versioned dependency to libcomps dependencies for >= 0.1.8-1~.
    + Add versioned dependency to python*-rpm dependencies for >= 4.14.0-1~.
    + Add versioned dependency to python3-dnf dependency for current version.
    + Drop dependencies upon librepo, upstream did it and they should be
      transitive anyway.
    + Drop dependencies upon python-lzma.
    + Drop Python 2 binpkgs.
    + Reorder run-time dependencies.
    + Drop old Python{,3}-Version fields. The base python packages are new
      enough.
    + Add versioned build dependency on libmodulemd1 >= 1.4.0-1~.
    + Add versioned run-time dependency on libmodulemd1 >= 1.4.0-1~ to dnf.
    + Add build dependency on python-enum34.
    + Add run-time dependency on python-enum34 to dnf.
    + Add recommended dependency on python3-unbound to python3-dnf.
    + Add run-time dependency on python-unbound to yum4.
    + Add run-time dependency on deltarpm to yum4.
    + Drop python*-iniparse dependencies.
    + Add run-time dependency on sqlite3 to dnf.
    + Rename yum4 binpkg to nextgen-yum4.
    + Make yum4 a transitional package.
    + Let nextgen-yum4 Break, Replace and Provide earlier yum4 packages.
    + Let dnf break dnf-plugins-core << 4.0.6-1~.
    + Add dependencies upon python3-hawkey.
    + Fix python3-dnf suggestion to python3-dnf-doc, not python-dnf-doc.
    + Change versioned dh dependency to >= 9~.
    + Add Vcs-{Browser,Git} tags.
    + Add Multi-Arch tags to binpkgs.
    + Drop {lib,}python3-dev build dependencies, we really only need the
      interpreter since no libraries are being generated/compiled.
    + Add python3 build dependency.
    + Split up dnf into dnf and dnf-data binpkgs to avoid circular
      dependencies.
    + Let dnf depend upon dnf-data.
    + Change python3-dnf dependency from dnf to dnf-data, breaking the
      dependency loop.
  * debian/rules:
    + Make dh_missing fail on uninstalled files.
    + Create and use temporary home directory for tests.
    + Better quoting.
    + Stop creating tests/dnfpersist, cmake will already do that.
    + Remove yum compat files we do not want to install, because they are
      provided by the proper yum package. Roughly corresponds to dnf.spec's
      yum_compat_level = preview.
    + Remove automatic files we do not want to install because we do not need
      or want any automatic updates in Debian.
    + Drop Python 2 support.
    + Remove integrated copies of {jquery,underscore}.js.
    + Also remove dnf-automatic-3 binary.
    + Quote $@ variable in dh call.
    + Re-root HTML documentation to an "html" subdir.

    + Pass BASH_COMPLETION_FALLBACKDIR to low-effortly support older distros.
    + Add run-time dependency upon python3-distutils or its former package
      libpython3-stdlib (but only if earlier than 3.7~) to python3-librepo.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Update.
  * debian/:
    + Rename yum4.install to nextgen-yum4.install.
    + Add nextgen-yum4.links.
    + Add dnf.links.
    + Remove nextgen-yum4.install, content moved to nextgen-yum4.links.

    + Drop python-* files.
    + Add python3-dnf-doc.doc-base.
    + Drop dnf.bash-completion or rather move content to dnf.install. The build
      system already installs the file to the correct location in most
      occasions. For old distros, we can provide a workaround.
    + Add source/lintian-overrides.
    + Rename dnf.dirs to dnf-data.dirs.

      since the whole test has been stubbed out.

          9f9392c81dc493898dfab072cf0c7b1ae99df186-
          0d47031b4deb3167ecdab7b3c0f5a75142e5d8be.patch as applied by Fedora
      in order to not let dnf use the highest available version or just fail.
    + Add 800100_dnf_db_group.py_revert-consequences-of-fail-safe-mechanism-
          a8a3cf4247fe374855e1ee292eb2b4bda835f690-
          ff341af41b821280643af4d0954a5f2ae4e9adc8.patch as applied by Fedora
      to not error out when missing modular data, but rather just issue a
      warning.
    + Add 800200_dnf_rpm___init__.py_revert-detection-for-armv7hcnl-
          9eab5a74b5b67f47ade3f0621e0b86b5203022db-

    + Create dnf-3 -> yum4 symlink.
    + Create dnf.8.gz -> yum4.8.gz symlink.
  * debian/dnf.links:
    + Create dnf-3 -> dnf symlink.
    + Create dnf-3 -> dnf symlinks for man pages.
  * debian/nextgen-yum4.lintian-overrides:
    + Ignore false-positive warning for a possible spelling mistake.
  * debian/python3-dnf-doc.links:
    + Replace {jquery,underscore}.js with system versions.
  * debian/python3-dnf-doc.docs:

  * debian/python3-dnf-doc.doc-base:
    + Register user manual and Python API documentation.
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides:
    + Silence warning about an "empty" section. Debian wants to ignore the
